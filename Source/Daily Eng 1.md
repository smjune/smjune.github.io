I asked her once how she managed to master diplomacy and espionage in a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either. 
She said 
"Compromise where you can. Where you can't, don't. Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world is telling you to move, it's your duty to plant yourself like a tree, look at them in the eye, and say, 'No, you move.' 
  
The amazing thing is the assistant can actually understand the nuances of conversation. 
We've been working on this technology for many years in natural language understanding, deep learning, text-to-speech. 
By the way, When we are done., the assistant can give you a confirmation notification saying your appointment has been taken care of. 
Let's say you want to call a restaurant but maybe it's a small restaurant which is not easily available to book online. 
The call actually goes a bit differently than expected. 
We have many of these examples where the calls quite don't go as expected. 
But the assistant understands the context, the nuance. 
It knew to ask for wait time in this case and handle the the interaction gracefully. 
But we're still developing this technology and we actually want to work hard to get this right, 
get the user experience and the expectation right for both businesses and users. 
But done correctly, it will save time for people and generate a lot of value for businesses. 
We really want it to work in cases say, If you're a busy parent in the morning and your kind is sick 
and you want to call for a doctor's appointment. 
So we're gonna work hard to get this right.

Releasing a new version of your app is an exciting moment when your team's hard work finally gets into the hands of your users. 
you want to keep your existing users happy without introducing performance regressions or bugs. 
we talked about staged releases as an essential part of how Google does app releases, allowing you to manage the inherent risks of a new release by making a new version of your app available to just a fraction of your users. 
We will take a closer look at how Modules work, and how you can use them as part of your review process. 
You can then increase this fraction as you gain confidence that your new version works as expected.

After a successful developer preview over the past few months, the API is now generally available. 
to give you the ability to build photo and video experiences in your products that are smarter, faster, and more helpful. 
You can use smart filters, like content categories, to narrow down or exclude certain types of photos. 
But thinking of them as "stuff you worry about later" will set you up for failure when it comes time for your user to interact with your Action on Google. 
Let's see what a sample dialog looks like using that strategy.

In a post on its developer’s blog, Google unveiled a sneak peek at Project Treble, which it says is “the biggest change to the low-level system architecture of Android to date.” 
  
## 20081002 
In addition to the architectural changes, Google is working with its partners to move their code changes into the common Android Open Source Project codebase. 
It is important that these new releases find their way to mobile devices as fast as possible.

A government agency was tasked to make certain that standards for food production are complied with. 
- Module owners are tasked to make certain that review steps for their change management are complied with. 
Next, to capitalize on the foundation we built, we collaborated closely with the silicon manufacturers. 
Bringing the new Android release quickly to the hands of users takes a combined effort between Google, silicon manufacturers (SM), device manufacturers (OEMs), and carriers. 
Finding a job takes a lot of effort (time) and a great amount of money. 
-> This request requires aligning the schedules between our internal partners of SE team because changing a policy and work process takes a lot of effort and time.   
By making it possible for newer AOSP frameworks to run on older, already-released vendor implementations, Project Treble dramatically reduces the need for continuous investment in older silicon to support each Android release. 
OEMs adapt the vendor implementation to their hardware and add their own custom framework components. 
  
## 20181005 
Android developers are loving the language with over 97% satisfaction in our most recent survey. 
While Module data (P4 Path, Moderator) had manually been updated to SWARM project for a couple of months, we introduced official support for integrating with SWARM earlier May, 2018 after devising a more efficient means of serving review process.

We launched Gmail Add-ons, a new way for developers to integrate their apps into Gmail across platforms. 
-> we launched a new way, Gmail Add-ons, which developers can integrate their apps into Gmail across platforms. 
-> we launched SWARM Integrations, a new way for Module Owners to integrate their Module into SWARM porject. 
While the controls that are in place give people peace-of-mind and have worked well, today, we're introducing even stronger controls and policies to give our users the confidence they need to keep their data safe. 
-> I know while you have loved me since we met , but I feel you're changing for some reason 
And until we get there, we must not ease the powerful worldwide sanctions that are in place.

## 20181011 
We regularly update our Android Module Owner policies and today have introduced stronger controls and new policies to keep our data safe. Here are a few updates: 
Our Google Play Developer policies are designed to provide a safe and secure experience for our users while also giving developers the tools they need to succeed. 
To provide additional assurances for users, today we are announcing new policies, focused on Gmail APIs, which will go into effect January 9, 2019. 
We are publishing these changes in advance to provide time for developers who may need to adjust their apps or policies to comply. 
we encourage developers to migrate to Add-ons where possible as their preferred platform. 
- where possible use plastics or ceramics to avoid sliding metal on metal contacts. 
Users allowing applications to access their email without their regular direct interaction will be provided with additional warnings and we will require them to re-consent to access at regular intervals. 
- Owner allowing Developers to submit a CL to their depot without review will be provided with additional warnings and we will require them to apply with review process. 
  
## 20181012 
Allow clients to look at each installation and work order in real time to get a solid understanding of where their integrator is working daily. 
Provide the right specialist with the right depth of knowledge and materials to go onsite, and evaluate and fix more than one issue during one service call, the first time. 
Offer tracking for a customer’s spend on a site-by-site basis, allowing them to accurately budget, plan, and forecast. 
Look for opportunities to offer cost-saving alternatives to ongoing service issues. 
If you ask companies that don’t utilize a single systems integrator about their current annual security spend, they would need to reach out to each of their integrators to get estimates, evaluate how they’re working, and then cull through the data to come up with a number. 
  
## 20181015 
Several office staff went in advance of the presenters to take care of details before the arrivals of the attendees. 
Some Android apps ask for permission to access a user's phone (including call logs) and SMS data. Going forward, Google Play will limit which apps are allowed to ask for these permissions. Only an app that has been selected as a user's default app for making calls or text messages will be able to access call logs and SMS, respectively. 
  
Any one as a TG member used to submit a CL to some code bases of Android Platform with self-applied rule. As previously announced, Since July 18, 2018,  We have limited which CLs are allowed to get into these. Only a CL that has been reviewed and approved by module owner or moderators is able to make changes of code base available. 
  
We'll be working with our developer partners to give them appropriate time to adjust and update their apps, and will begin enforcement 90 days from this policy update. 
In the coming months, we'll be rolling out additional controls and policies across our various products and platforms, and will continue to work with you, our developers, to help with the transition.

In less than a month, we'll be kicking off Android Dev Summit 2018, broadcasting live from the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, CA on November 7 and 8. 
  
The summit kicks off on November 7 at 10AM PST with the keynote, where you'll hear directly from Dave Burke and others on the present and future of Android development. From there, we'll dive into two tracks (and two days!) of deep technical content from the Google engineering team, on topics such as Android Pie, Android Studio, Kotlin, Android Jetpack, Google Play and more. We'll also have demos and office hours for those attending in person; more on that in the coming weeks! 
  
if you were one of those who expressed interest but didn't receive a ticket, we've already reached out to you and shared this news, but we want to apologize again that we weren't able to find you a spot. 
  
Rest assured, though, that we're still doing all that we can to free up more tickets, and we'll be reaching out to folks we're able to accommodate in the lead-up to the show.  -> (사람 수용)

The central bank recently decreased interest rates on small loans to accommodate a growing demand for capital by people interested in starting a business.  -> (의견 수용)

Android's security model is enforced by the Linux kernel, which makes it a tempting target for attackers 
  
55% of indirect calls have <5 allowed targets. 
  
In an Android device kernel, LLVM's CFI limits 55% of indirect calls to at most 5 possible targets and 80% to at most 20 targets. 
75 module out of 655 have ≥ 2 TGs who are changing code base at the same time. 
  
Memory protections make code injection more challenging. 
It significantly restricts the valid call targets, which makes exploiting such a bug more difficult in practice. 

You can rest assured that you’re going to get a good deal. 

Now, this is all sounding pretty fishy. Sorry, But rest assured that, these will not make you burger taste like seafood.   

Rest assured we’ll be right back. 

## 20181017 
Implementation adds a check before each indirect branch to confirm that ~ 
-Review process should add a check before each CL commits into P4 to confirm that Module owner have approved code changes. 
-Module Owner should add a check before each CL commits into P4 to confirm that code changes have been verified by moderators. 
This is the third in a series of blog posts in which outline strategies and guidance in Android with regard to power. 
Whether the Google Pixel 3 XL is the best Android phone is up for debate, but 
it's the most advanced Pixel ever, and that's what matters. / it’s the fastest Android phone I’ve ever used. / the all-glass back of it is one of the nicest I’ve ever used. 
  
It would be one thing if there was some next-generation camera or sensor that demanded such a large notch. But as it stands, there appears to be a lot of unnecessary space around the twin cameras, ambient light sensor, and speaker that live inside it. 
93 percent of the growth that occurred in 2010 went to the upper one percent. So again, most Americans are not sharing in what's going on.

It turns out, as we spend each autumn examining and comparing specs on these new rectangular pieces of hardware, the thing that matters most is the software running on them. And that’s likely to be the case for the foreseeable future / in future.

An additional integration from Xender is planned in the coming weeks. 
Protected Confirmation also adds additional security relative to other forms of secondary authentication, such as a One Time Password or Transaction Authentication Number.
